A program for solving the inverse Potts problem

TODO:
----
* separate labeling for 1-body and 2-body terms
* allow for several 2-body bins (aka distance bins)
* implement checkpointing / saving
* (+) test output (is it meaningful? compare with previous results)
* check for memory leaks
* README with examples
* (+) add License (MIT?)
* add (pseudo)Fisher matrix
* allow for different 1-body and 2-body sets of states
